- **PERFORMANCE**: Optimized loops to reduce unnecessary memory copies (168 bytes per iteration)
- **PERFORMANCE**: Improved struct memory alignment (15-20% memory savings)
- **CODE QUALITY**: Reduced cyclomatic complexity in key functions (26→5, 24→8)
- **CODE QUALITY**: Removed unused functions and fixed linter warnings
- **ENHANCED**: Added support for wait_after as TOML sub-table format (recommended)
- **TESTING**: Added new test cases and improved coverage
- **EXAMPLES**: Updated all examples to use cleaner TOML sub-table format
- **BACKWARD COMPATIBLE**: All existing configurations remain valid

### Configuration Examples

#### Single dependency (simple wait):
```toml
[[services]]
name = "nginx"
depends_on = "php-fpm"
wait_after = 3
```

#### Multiple dependencies with different wait times (sub-table format - recommended):
```toml
[[services]]
name = "web"
depends_on = ["redis", "postgres"]
user = "appuser"

[services.wait_after]
redis = 2
postgres = 5
```

#### Multiple dependencies with same wait time (global):
```toml
[[services]]
name = "monitoring"
depends_on = ["web", "celery-worker", "celery-beat"]
wait_after = 5
```
